  <h2 id='getting_a_fitbit'>Getting a Fitbit</h2>

<p>Back in 2006, my wife came up with an idea for her Master&#8217;s thesis around the concept of a <a href='http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1125797'>gamified pedometer</a> and &#8220;tackled the challenge of motivating people <span>&#8230;</span> to exercise more <span>using</span> a device which encourages physical activity of its users in an entertaining way and reinforces positive exercise habits.&#8221; Here I am in 2014; considering getting a Fitbit (a little pre-Christmas gift to myself?)</p>

<p>Which one should I get?</p>

<h3 id='making_a_choice'>Making a Choice</h3>

<p>As I scan the <a href='http://www.fitbit.com/compare'>Fitbit website</a>, it&#8217;s obivous I need to figure out what my main Use Case is going to be.</p>

<p>Checking out the <a href='http://www.fitbit.com/chargehr'>Charge HR</a>, I&#8217;m reminded of a time years ago when I used something very similar: my Timex Ironman Triathlon heart-rate monitor! Wondering where it was, I dug around in my belongings and sure enough, I found it (albeit dusty):</p>

<p><img alt='Timex Ironman Triathlon' src='./images/photos/timex_ironman.jpg' /></p>

<p>Wow; not sure how long ago I got that. I think I was living in Vienna, so it&#8217;s at least eight years old. I could have sworn I got it shipped to me via Amazon but I don&#8217;t see it listed anywhere in my last 12 years (12!) of order history with them, so I must have picked it up there at some brick-and-mortar store.</p>

<p>Anyways, the Charge HR isn&#8217;t even available yet and judging by how much dust the Timex has collected in the last five years, maybe that&#8217;s not the best model for me right now.</p>

<p>The <a href='http://www.fitbit.com/surge'>Surge</a> looks like it does everything under the sun. &#8220;Music Control&#8221; - very intriguing. One problem; also not yet available.</p>

<p>While comparing the wearable models, I came across the <a href='http://www.fitbit.com/aria'>Aria</a> and wonder how it compares with the <a href='http://www.withings.com/us/smart-body-analyzer.html'>Withings scale</a>. I bet the value-add is how well it integrates within the Fitbit ecosystem.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a little hesitant to even consider any of the timepiece models as a replacement for the <a href='http://www.skagen.com/us/en/products/grenen-mens-steel-mesh-and-titanium-case-watch-pdp233lttmp.html'>beautiful watch</a> my wife got me for my birthday years ago, so that rules out the Charge, Charge HR, and the Surge and really only leaves the Zip, One, and Flex.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been waking up fairly early recently so I definitely think it would be helpful to have a model that tracks my sleep habits, eliminating the Zip.</p>

<h3 id='conclusion'>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Between the One and the Flex, I think I&#8217;m going to go with the <a href='http://www.fitbit.com/one'>One</a>. I really don&#8217;t want to wear a second item on my wrist in addition to my watch so the One it is.</p>

  <p>I&#8217;ve seen this error a number of times:</p>

<p><code>Cannot perform operations on a Metamorph that is not in the DOM</code></p>

<p>&#8230; and I&#8217;ll admit, I&#8217;ve not known exactly what a Metamorph is but for the most part, I can usually remember whatever it was that I just did that caused the error, undo, and find a different way.</p>

<p>Today, the thought crossed my mind: &#8220;What <em>is</em> a Metamorph?&#8221; and that&#8217;s when I went digging.</p>

<p>I knew from having seen the &#8220;metamorph-#-start/end&#8221; references in script tags that it was part of the magic that makes Ember.js bindings work, but I didn&#8217;t know exactly where it came from.</p>

<p>Suprisingly, I couldn&#8217;t find any search results answering the question. It was only after digging through some stackoverflow answers that my curiosity was satisfied when I found <a href='https://github.com/tomhuda/metamorph.js/'>this</a>.</p>

  <p><strong>tl;dr : Capybara with phantomjs is the fastest solution around</strong></p>

<p>Years ago, I loved <a href='http://seleniumhq.org/'>Selenium</a> for everything it made possible, particularly for the <a href='https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/selenium-ide/'>Firefox plugin</a> that made it so easy to script-record a user acceptance test and dump it for automation.</p>

<p>Over the years, I have done my fair share of futzing around with Selenium, and when I took a look at <a href='https://github.com/FrozenCanuck/Lebowski'>Lebowski</a> a few months ago, I thought I had found a silver bullet. It&#8217;s really a clean solution for managing everything around acceptance testing, that is, if you&#8217;re going to use Selenium.</p>

<p>Today, my solution of choice is <a href='https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara'>Capybara</a> with <a href='http://phantomjs.org/'>PhantomJS</a>/<a href='https://github.com/jonleighton/poltergeist'>poltergeist</a></p>

<p>So far, Capybara&#8217;s DSL is so clean and robust for programmatically defining any user action I&#8217;ve come up with. I don&#8217;t have any benchmarks to share at this time for vanilla-Capybara tests vs. Capybara w/headless JS (poltergeist) but suffice it to say, I spend noticably less time at the command line.</p>

<p>More to come on how to (acceptance) test your Ember.js apps using Capybara/poltergeist.</p>

  <p>I finally brought <a href='https://github.com/inkredabull/resumatic'>Resumatic</a> into the 21st century; it&#8217;s now a Rails 3.2.0 app.</p>

<p>While I originally intended to go <a href='http://railscasts.com/episodes/225-upgrading-to-rails-3-part-1'>step-by-step</a>, whereby I was going to wrap the app with some regression tests, upgrade, run the tests to prove I didn&#8217;t (or did) break something, and then be happy, I soon tired of that given the many dependencies (RSpec, rvm, Rails, etc.)</p>

<p>Given the size of the app, I just decided to get a fresh gemset, install Rails 3.2.0, create a new container project via &#8216;new&#8217;, and then copy all the necessary files from the Rails 2 version in to the Rails 3 container, tweaking wherever new syntax was required.</p>

<p>Someday I&#8217;ll add tests&#8230;</p>
