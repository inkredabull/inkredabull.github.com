## Meditation Apps

A few months ago, I decided to investigate which smartphone apps there might be to support a meditation practice.

Almost immediately, I found [calm.com](http://www.calm.com).  There are two versions: free and paid (subscription.)  

The free has a basic timer and a limited feature set of paid version which provdies access to a number of
different background scenes, background white noise, and an assortment of guided meditations.
I paid for a quarterly subscription and used that app for a few months but have recently canceled my
subscription. Even though I found the woman's voice of the guided meditations pleasant, I eventually found
myself annoyed with the monotony of her style and inflection and the way the meditations seem programmatically assembled. I found myself using the premium content of guided meditations lesson less and less and instead found myself more often using the timer feature.

Recently a friend brought my attention to [Insight Timer](https://insighttimer.com/).  I was immediately drawn to the pleasant sounding 
Buddhist bells and I like that they have a library of different guided meditation's from different 
recognized practitioners.  I also like that there's only a (nominal) one-time fee for upgrade.
FWIW. 

DISCLAIMER: I do not stand to financially benefit for advertising either product.  I'm merely 
finding it helpful to share the information I've collected in support of a regular meditation practice.
